This folder contains the AsciiDoc source file used to produce the HTML, XML (DOCBOOK), EPUB, MOBI and PDF output.

LATEST NEWS:   
[Oct-11-2017] I improved the section that introduces the 'repeat' step.  
[Oct-10-2017] Several sections have been improved, I also made updates to reflect changes made in Tinkerpop 3.3

You can browse the '.adoc' file directly from within Git and it will work but you will not get the full color coding and other niceties that are present in the HTML and PDF versions as they have been run through an AsciiDoc processor and had various style sheets and code pretty printers applied. Your mileage may vary but I find the HTML version to be the most pleasing to read.

To read the HTML file please either downloaded or visit http://kelvinlawrence.net/book/Gremlin-Graph-Guide.html as it is too big for Git to display. 

Also while Git will display the PDF file if you click on it, it does not enable the hyper links etc. To view the PDF please either download it and use a PDF viewer or visit http://kelvinlawrence.net/book/Gremlin-Graph-Guide.pdf

The XML (DOCBOOK) file is generated using Asciidoctor and can be viewed on Linux using the Yelp tool among many others or used to produce other formats. The EPUB and MOBI files can be viewed using most popular e-book readers and some browsers.

Please note that the DOCBOOK, EPUB and MOBI format files currently do not have all of the nice source code highlighting and colors that the HTML and PDF versions have.
