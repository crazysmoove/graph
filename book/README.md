This folder contains the AsciiDoc source file used to produce the HTML and PDF output.

You can browse the '.adoc' file directly from within Git and it will work but you will not get the full color coding and other niceties that are present in the HTML and PDF versions as they have been run through an AsciiDoc processor and had various style sheets and code pretty printers applied. Your mileage may vary but I find the HTML version to be the most pleasing to read.
