You can browse the 'Gremlin-Graph-Guide.adoc' file directly from within Git and it will work but you will not get the full color coding and other niceties that are present in the HTML and PDF versions as they have been run through an AsciiDoc processor and had various style sheets and code pretty printers applied. Your mileage may vary but I find the HTML version to be the most pleasing to read. The '.adoc' file will always contain the most recent updates. The other formats (HTML,DocBook,ePub and MOBI) will be generated regularly once there are enough updates to make it worthwhile generating a 'release'. The other formats can be generated by running the 'make-book.sh' script.

To read the HTML file please either downloaded it to your computer or visit http://kelvinlawrence.net/book/Gremlin-Graph-Guide.html as it is too big for Git to display. 

Also while Git will display the PDF file if you click on it, it does not enable the hyper links. To view the PDF please either download it and use a PDF viewer or visit http://kelvinlawrence.net/book/Gremlin-Graph-Guide.pdf

The XML (DOCBOOK) file is generated using Asciidoctor and can be viewed on Linux using the Yelp tool among many others or used to produce other formats. The EPUB and MOBI files can be viewed using most popular e-book readers and some browsers.

Please note that the DOCBOOK, EPUB and MOBI format files currently do not have all of the nice source code highlighting and colors that the HTML and PDF versions have.
